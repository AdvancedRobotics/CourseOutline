# CourseOutline

Advanced Robotics consists of the following CTS modules:
* NET1010: Digital Technology 1
* NET2010: Digital Technology 2
* NET3030: Microprocessors
* NET3040: Microprocessor Interface
* NET3910: Project Credit

## NET1010: Digital Technology 1
Student construct and demonstrate logic systems and their unique functions.

## NET2010: Digital Technology 2
Students demonstrate knowledge of digital principles, by using small-scale transistor-transistor logic (TTL) and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integrated technology. 

## NET3030: Microprocessors
Students compare the internatl architecture of microprocessors/microcontrolers with real-woprld applications.

## NET3040: Microprocessor Interface
Students demonstrate how to interface microprocessors/microcontrollers with real-world applications.

## NET3910: Project Credit
Students develop project design and management skills to extend and enhance competencies and skills in other CTS courses through contexts that are personally relevant.
